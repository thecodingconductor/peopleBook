A CRM for the American Orchestral Industry

![OrchesNation](./client/src/layout/orchesNationShot.png)

Like any other career in any other industry, becoming an orchestral conductor relies on your ability to form a strong network of mentors, supporters, friends, and believers.

I decided to build myself an app that might help me in the process of reaching out to other people in the Orchestra world, and created OrchesNation. 

OrchesNation is a Full Stack MERN App. It uses React hooks and the Context API on the front end, with an ExpressJS backend and a RESTful API.

I created a Python webscraper to populate a MongoDB database*. The app features User Authenticated with JsonWebToken, and a fully responsive, mobile-first UI design.




*While building this app, My data source removed their data from public access. As a result, the data is incomplete in some places and will remain this way without some changes.
